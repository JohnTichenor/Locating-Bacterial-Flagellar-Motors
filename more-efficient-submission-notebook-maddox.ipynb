This notebook creates predictions on test data and generates the competition submission file.\n\n### Notebook Series:\n1. **[Parse Data](https://www.kaggle.com/code/andrewjdarley/parse-data)**: Extracting and preparing 2D slices containing motors to make a YOLO dataset\n2. **[Visualize Data](https://www.kaggle.com/code/andrewjdarley/visualize-data)**: Exploratory data analysis and visualization of annotated motor locations\n3. **[Train YOLO](https://www.kaggle.com/code/andrewjdarley/train-yolo)**: Fine tuning an YOLOv8 object detection model on the prepared dataset\n4. **Submission Notebook (Current)**: Running inference and generating submission files \n\n## Important: Offline Execution\nThis notebook is designed to run in an offline environment. The Ultralytics YOLOv8 package has been installed using the offline installation method from [this reference notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/code/itsuki9180/ultralytics-for-offline-install). This implementation was brilliant. I use my own copy as input that works effectively the same as the original.\n\n## About this Notebook\n\nThis submission notebook implements an optimized inference pipeline that:\n\n1. **Model Loading**: Loads the best trained YOLOv8 weights from the training notebook\n2. **GPU Optimization**: Configures CUDA optimizations, half-precision inference, and memory management\n3. **Parallel Processing**: Uses CUDA streams and batch processing for efficient GPU utilization\n4. **3D Detection**: Processes each slice to locate motors\n5. **Non-Maximum Suppression**: Applies 3D NMS to cluster and merge detections across slices\n6. **Submission Generation**: Creates the final CSV file with predicted motor coordinates\n\nThe code includes advanced optimizations like dynamic batch sizing based on available GPU memory, preloading batches while processing the current batch, and GPU profiling to monitor performance. The CONCENTRATION parameter can be adjusted to trade off between processing speed and detection accuracy. The only reason you'd ever modify CONCENTRATION is just to verify submission capability since full submission takes a few hours.","metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"!tar xfvz
